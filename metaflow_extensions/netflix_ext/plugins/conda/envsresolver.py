        that were newly resolved (ie: excludes ones that were already resolved prior
        to starting this EnvsResolver)

        Parameters
        ----------
        include_builder_envs : bool, optional
            If True, will also return builder environments that were built
            while resolving the main environments. In the case of PIP environments,
            we sometimes need to build another environment to build PIP packages
            and/or resolve the PIP dependencies, by default False

        Yields
        ------
        Iterator[Tuple[EnvID, ResolvedEnvironment, List[str]]]
            Each tuple element contains:
                - the environment ID for the environment
                - the ResolvedEnvironment
                - the list of step names this environment pertains to.
